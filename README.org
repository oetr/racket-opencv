This project ports a subset of the [[http://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] library to Racket by using the [[http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/index.html?q=ctype&q=_cpointer&q=make-cvector&q=time*&q=time&q=yield][Racket Foreign Interface]].
Check the /turorials/ folder to get started.

* Installation
=git clone https://github.com/oetr/racket-opencv.git=  

=cd racket-opencv=  

=raco pkg install=


* Style
Names of OpenCV structures and functions have been left unchanged, i.e., C function =cvCaptureFromCAM (int index)= can be used in Racket as =(cvCaptureFromCAM index)=.
